A Bank Loan Analysis project using SQL and Power BI aims to extract valuable insights from bank loan data to improve decision-making, risk management, and overall loan portfolio performance. SQL is used for data manipulation and initial analysis, while Power BI provides interactive dashboards for data visualization and further exploration.

     driven decissions and assess the health of loan portfolio.
  # SQL Oueries
   SQL queries can be used to shape data before it's loaded into Power BI. Connecting to a SQL database in Power BI allows easily to retrieve and analyze data directly from SQL database, enabling to create interactive visualizations and reports based on SQL data. Import the data which is financial_loan.csv file and execute the queries required.
