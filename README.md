# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Using-SQL-and-Power-Bi-
A Bank Loan Analysis project using SQL and Power BI aims to extract valuable insights from bank loan data to improve decision-making, risk management, and overall loan portfolio performance. SQL is used for data manipulation and initial analysis, while Power BI provides interactive dashboards for data visualization and further exploration. 
## Project Objective
The objective is to gain insights into a bank's lending activities and portfolio performance. This involves analyzing various aspects like loan applications, funding, repayments, and borrower demographics to identify trends, assess financial health, and support strategic decision-making.

  overall cost.
- Average debt to income ratio: Evaluating the average DTI for borrowers helps to guage their financial health. Compute the DTI for all loans, month to date and track month over month fluctuations.
  # Loan Status Grid View
     In ordet to gain a comprehensive overview of lending operations and monitor the performance of loans grid view report is created by categorising loan status. By providing insights into metrics such as
     Total loan applications,Total funded amount, Total amount received, month to date funded amount, amount received, Average interest rate and Average debt to income ratio. This grid view helps to make data
     driven decissions and assess the health of loan portfolio.
  # SQL Queries
   SQL queries can be used to shape data before it's loaded into Power BI. Connecting to a SQL database in Power BI allows easily to retrieve and analyze data directly from SQL database, enabling to create interactive visualizations and reports based on SQL data. Import the data which is financial_loan.csv file and execute the queries required.

 # Power BI
   Imported the data from Sql server and started building the dashboards. Three dashboards are built. First one helps to visualise the percentages 
   of good loan issued and bad loan issued. Loan status is also presented in the dashboard. Second one shows the visualisation graphs of total loan
   applications in terms of month,state,term,employee length,purpose and home ownership. Third one shows the overall status regarding banking loan
   analysis.
